“Your” means each person that installs, executes, accesses, stores, copies, modifies (to the extent
permitted in this Agreement), distributes or otherwise makes use of the Licensed Software (each
a ​ **“Use”** ​). You are only authorized to Use the Licensed Software if You agree fully comply with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Otherwise, if you do not agree to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, You may not Use the Licensed Software in any manner, and You
should in that case immediately delete any copies of the Licensed Software that You may have
made.
You acknowledge and agree that (A) Licensor has spent considerable time, effort and
resources in the development of the Licensed Software, and that the Licensed Software contains
valuable intellectual property rights owned by the Licensor, and (B) Your right to Use the
Licensed Software (as set forth and limited by this Agreement) constitutes good and valuable
consideration exchanged for Your agreement to the terms and conditions herein and the
consideration​ ​paid​ ​for​ ​the​ ​Purchased​ ​Tokens.
You​ ​therefore​ ​further​ ​agree​ ​as​ ​follows:

1. Definitions.​ The following terms when used with initial capital letters shall have
the​ ​meanings​ ​stated​ ​below:
(a) “ **Authorized** ​ **Nodes** ”​ means the collection of all installed instances of the
executable portions of the Licensed Software, where each such instance is connected to
all​ ​other​ ​such​ ​instances​ ​via​ ​direct​ ​or​ ​indirect​ ​peer-to-peer​ ​network​ ​connections.
    (b) “ **Authorized** ​ **Protocol** ​” means the rules, data structures, programming
language, scripts, cryptographic signing methods, and communication protocols solely as
specified and defined by Licensor from time to time, that provide the sole mechanism for
the addition of new transactions and contracts to the applicable Blockchain, verification
of such additions, and achieving consensus among Authorized Nodes regarding the
validity and immutability of such Blockchain; provided that, after the Community
Release Date, the Authorized Protocol shall mean such version of the Authorized
Protocol in effect on the Community Release Date, or as applicable any amendment
thereafter made by the required consensus of Authorized Nodes (determined in
accordance with the Authorized Protocol in effect immediately prior to such amendment).
(c) “ **Blockchain** ” means the distributed, public, digital ledger containing
records (blocks) evidencing transactions and contracts, structured and signed via digital
encrypted signatures in accordance with the Authorized Protocol, which blocks are
formed, confirmed by consensus, and extended solely by Authorized Nodes running the
Licensed​ ​Software​ ​in​ ​accordance​ ​with​ ​the​ ​Authorized​ ​Protocol.
(d) “ **Community ​ Release** ”​ means a future version of the Licensed Software
designated by Licensor as the “Community Release Version 1.0,” together with any
permitted modification of such Licensed Software developed and distributed in

June​ ​30,​ ​2018.
(e) “ **Community ​ Release Blockchain** ”​ means a new Blockchain that will be
initiated with a new genesis block on the Community Release Date, and that will
continue​ ​from​ ​and​ ​after​ ​the​ ​Community​ ​Release​ ​Date.

Community​ ​Release​ ​version​ ​available​ ​to​ ​You.

Release​ ​Date​ ​that​ ​shall​ ​terminate​ ​on​ ​the​ ​Community​ ​Release​ ​Date.
(h) “ **Purchased ​ Tokens** ”​ means Tokens that You purchase directly from the
Licensor​ ​prior​ ​to​ ​the​ ​Community​ ​Release​ ​Date.
(i) “ **Token** ​ ”​ means a data packet, structured and signed via digital encrypted
signatures in accordance with the Authorized Protocol, which data packet is included in
the applicable Blockchain and transferable via the applicable Blockchain in accordance
with the Authorized Protocol. A “Token” is “contained” in a Wallet if such Token is
registered on the Blockchain to a public key or keys contained in such Wallet determined
in​ ​accordance​ ​with​ ​the​ ​Authorized​ ​Protocol.
(j) “ **Wallet**​ ​” means the executable portion of the Licensed Software that
includes generated private and public cryptographic keys used for signing and encrypting

the​ ​sole​ ​purpose​ ​of​ ​acquiring​ ​a​ ​Purchased​ ​Token​ ​to​ ​be​ ​contained​ ​in​ ​Your​ ​Wallet.
(c) Token Transfer and Reset.​ You may transfer a Token contained in Your
Wallet via the Initial Blockchain solely through Use of the Licensed Software, so long as
you maintain at least one Token in Your Wallet. You acknowledge and agree, however,
that any such transfer of Tokens occurring on the Initial Blockchain shall be disregarded
from​ ​and​ ​after​ ​the​ ​Community​ ​Release​ ​Date.

4. Community​ ​Release​.​ ​​ ​From​ ​and​ ​after​ ​the​ ​Community​ ​Release​ ​Date:
    (a) You shall only Use a Community Release version of the Licensed

Wallet using the Community Release version of the Licensed Software promptly after the
Community Release Date, and understand that providing an incorrect or invalid public
address may result in permanent loss of Your Purchased Token, and no refund shall be
provided​ ​in​ ​such​ ​case.
    (c) You may distribute a Community Release version of the Licensed

of the Authorized Protocol published by Licensor and in effect as of the Community
Release Date, or as applicable (ii) the then current amended version of the Authorized
Protocol if such Authorized Protocol has been amended by the required consensus of
Authorized Nodes (determined in accordance with the Authorized Protocol in effect
immediately​ ​prior​ ​to​ ​such​ ​amendment).
(e) Subject to Your compliance with this Section 4(e), You may modify the
Community Version of the Licensed Software solely for the purposes of: (i) improving
the Licensed Software only for use with the Community Release Blockchain in a manner
that fully complies with the then current Authorized Protocol, or (ii) developing a test
version of Licensed Software for testing Use in connection with a good faith proposal by
You or another person to modify the Authorized Protocol; provided in each case,
however, that You agree that any such modified version of the Licensed Software shall
be subject to this Agreement and shall only be distributed by You to any other person
subject to this Agreement (and no other agreement). You shall distribute a complete
copy of the source code for any such modified version of the Licensed Software together
with Your distribution of such modified Licensed Software, and shall include a copy of
this Agreement with any such distribution. You shall not impose any additional or
different terms or conditions in connection with any such modified version of the
Licensed Software. You acknowledge and agree that any modifications of the Licensed
Software that You develop shall be owned by the Licensor and shall be deemed part of
the Licensed Software under this Agreement. If You modify the Licensed Software, You
represent and warrant to Licensor and to each person who directly or indirectly receives a
copy of Your modified version of the Licensed Software that such modified version of
the Licensed Software is not subject to any patent or other intellectual property rights that
may impose any royalty or payment obligation or otherwise restrict or condition the
rights of Licensor or such persons under this Agreement with respect to such modified
Licensed Software. If You do not agree with or cannot comply with the foregoing terms
and conditions regarding modification of the Licensed Software, then You may not make
or​ ​distribute​ ​any​ ​modifications​ ​to​ ​the​ ​Licensed​ ​Software.
(f) You may Use a test version of the Licensed Software (that does not
comply with the then current Authorized Protocol or that You are testing to confirm
compliance with such Authorized Protocol) that You or any other person develops in
accordance with this Agreement solely in a test environment for non-commercial and
non-production development and testing purposes with a copy of the Blockchain, and not
in​ ​connection​ ​with​ ​the​ ​then​ ​current​ ​Community​ ​Release​ ​Blockchain.
